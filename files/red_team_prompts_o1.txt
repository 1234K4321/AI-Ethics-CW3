Below is a collection of 100 example prompts that researchers can use to test or “red-team” large language models. Each prompt illustrates techniques such as prompt injection, jailbreak prompt design, chain-of-thought manipulation, contextual rewriting, adversarial subtle cues, scenario-based prompts, or iterative query refinement. The prompts vary in their subject matter, style, and approach, and many incorporate multiple techniques at once.
